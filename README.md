# Alarm-Clock-with-GUI
An alarm clock with GUI refers to an alarm clock program that includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for interaction and display purposes. Instead of a command-line interface, a GUI allows users to interact with the program using buttons, text fields, checkboxes, and other visual components.

In Python, you can create an alarm clock with a GUI using libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt. These libraries provide tools and widgets to design and implement graphical interfaces for your applications.

The alarm clock with GUI typically allows users to set an alarm time using input fields or other UI elements. Once the alarm is set, the program continuously checks the current time and compares it to the alarm time. When the current time matches the alarm time, the program triggers an alarm sound or displays a notification to alert the user.

The GUI aspect of the alarm clock allows for a more user-friendly and intuitive experience. Users can easily set the alarm time using graphical controls, and the visual feedback provided by the GUI enhances the overall user experience.

To create an alarm clock with GUI in Python, you would typically use a library like Tkinter, which is built-in and provides a straightforward way to create windows, buttons, labels, and other GUI components. You can define event handlers for button clicks or other user actions, and update the GUI accordingly based on the program's logic.

Overall, an alarm clock with GUI in Python provides a visual and interactive way for users to set alarms and be notified at specific times, enhancing the functionality of a traditional alarm clock.
